        <p>Condition: Extremely broken in, Well maintained</p><br>

    	<p>Have had my Aolong V2 for 2 years now.<br> 
    	Is extremely well broken in but unfortunately still has the clicky feeling I extremely dislike.<br>
    	It is my got-to cube for traveling.</p> <br>

    	<h1> Moyu Aolong V1 (white)</h1><br>
    	<p>PB: 16 seconds</p><br>
    	<p>Condition: Well worn, extremely well maintained</p><br>

    	<p> Have had my Aolong V1 for about a year and a half. <br>With bit of lube and tensioning, it is clearly my best performing cube. 
    	Unfortunately, even with these advantages, <br> whether from the color scheme or some other variable, <br>
    	 my times with this cube are extremely inconsistent, even if I do hold my overall best PB on this cube.</p><br>

    	<h1> Moyu Weilong (black)</h1><br>
    	<p> PB: 18 seconds<p><br>
    	<p>Condition: Abandoned, Sandy, Unmaintained
    	<p>When I initially got my Weilong I was extremely pleased with it's performance.<br>
    	However, when compared to the Aolong family this cube pales in comparison. It is sluggish,<br>
    	extremely boxy and unwieldly, and generally not a very forgiving cube.</p>
