<i>
Allosaurus liked to bite, <br>

It's teeth were sharp as sabers <br>

It frequently with great delight <br>

Made mincemeat of its neighbors.<br>

Allosaurus liked to hunt<br>

And when it caught its quarrey,<br>

It tore it open, back and front,<br>

And never said , "I'm sorry!"<br>

Allosaurus liked to eat<br>

And using teeth and talons<br>

It stuffed itself with tons of meat,<br>

And guzzled blood by gallons.<br>

Allosaurus liked to munch,<br>

And kept from growing thinner,<br>

By gnawing an enormous lunch,<br>

then rushing off to dinner.</p> </i>
